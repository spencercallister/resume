##### Legrande Health
*Data Engineering Intern* | Jan 2022 - Aug 2024 | Rexburg, ID
- Increased data ownership from 26% to 89% utilizing ETL processes, AWS services, and custom applications.
- Developed an interactive dashboard using Polars and Streamlit to visualize SMS data, tracking response times between agents and patients, opt-in success rates for automated reminders, and communication quality metrics to enhance patient engagement insights.
- Built and scheduled an AWS Lambda function to automate nightly API calls to Twilio, retrieving SMS data, storing it in S3 as Parquet files, and loading it into Amazon Redshift for analysis.
- Deployed an Ubuntu server on AWS EC2 using Docker to manage MongoDB collection listeners, wrangling data with Polars into Parquet files then stored in S3. Demonstrated skills in cloud infrastructure (EC2, S3), containerization (Docker), and data wrangling (Polars).
- Wrote a custom Node.js app using the Freshworks SDK and Twilio API to automate patient SMS invitations for reminder opt-ins, sending recurring reminders based on preferences. Utilized the Twilio SDK to capture patient responses and store them in Freshworks. Demonstrated expertise in API integration, Node.js, and automated messaging workflows.
